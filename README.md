This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
Aimed to provide an example Shipping Fulfillment App for [Wix App Market](https://dev.wix.com/docs/build-apps).


## Getting Started

The application requires the following environment variables to be set:
* `WIX_APP_ID` - The application ID in Wix Development Center (The application you created in Wix Development Center)
* `WIX_APP_SECRET` - The application secret in Wix Development Center, as described in the [Ouath flow documentation](https://dev.wix.com/docs/build-apps/build-your-app/authentication/oauth#step-4-app-requests-the-authorization-code)
* `WIX_APP_JWT_KEY` - Your application webhooks public key, as described in the [Webhooks documentation](https://dev.wix.com/docs/build-apps/developer-tools/apis-and-webhooks/webhooks#register-for-webhooks)

For local development, these variables should be set in the `.env.local` file, which is not committed to source control.
Also, they are all server side variables, your public key and secret should not be exposed to the client.<br>
You can use [`.env.template`](./.env.template) as a template.<br>
When deploying to production, these variables should be set as environment variables according to the hosting platform guidelines, for example:
* [Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/environment-variables/overview/)
* [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/environment-variables)

### Running the application locally
By default, the applications uses npm, but you can use yarn or pnpm as well.<br>
To install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install
```

To run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [https://localhost:3000/dashboard](https://localhost:3000/dashboard) with your browser to see the result.


## Features
### Dashboard page
![app dashboard](docs/assets/images/app-dashbaord.png)
  Pre-integrated with [Wix Design System](https://www.wixdesignsystem.com/) and [Wix Dashboard SDK](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/api-reference/dashboard/introduction)
* Including SSR support
  * Server components are not yet supported by Wix Design System, but SSR is supported.
* Provides a simple dashboard page with navigations to relevant pages and a simple example of a shipping delivery form
* Integrates with [Wix Data API](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/api-reference/data/items/query-data-items) to query last orders and present last 3 orders in the dashboard

**Note**: This example dashboard implementation does not include the actual persistence of the model to an actual DB

#### Development Entry point
1. [`dashboard/page.tsx`](./src/app/dashboard/page.tsx)
   * The page uses the sample app model implementation in [`app-data.model.ts`](./src/app/types/app-data.model.ts). It provides an array of shipping delivery methods, which can be extended to your needs
   * The dashboard page uses both the client side SDK implementation [`wix-sdk.client.ts`](./src/app/utils/wix-sdk.client.ts) and server side - [`wix-sdk.ssr.ts`](./src/app/utils/wix-sdk.ssr.ts) for SSR support.

### Delivery method SPI implementation
![Checkout Delivery method](docs/assets/images/checkout-delivery-methods.png)
* [Wix Checkout Delivery method SPI](https://dev.wix.com/docs/rest/api-reference/wix-e-commerce/shipping-rates-integration-spi/introduction) is used to provide a custom delivery methods for Wix checkout

#### Development Entry point
1. [`/api/shipping-rates/v1/getRates/`(route.ts)](./src/app/api/shipping-rates/v1/getRates/route.ts)
* Provides a simple implementation of a shipping delivery method, which can be extended to your needs. 
* The provided implementation receives the ordered items, their weight and quantity, and returns a list of delivery methods with their price and estimated delivery time
  * If the calculation of the delivery method is by weight, the implementation checks the unit of the weight, and converts it from KG to LB or vice versa if needed.

### Oauth
* Oauth integration with Wix using [Wix Apps OAuth API](https://dev.wix.com/docs/build-apps/build-your-app/authentication/oauth)
* Exchange authorization code for access token
* Get App instance information using the access token using [Get app instance API](https://dev.wix.com/docs/rest/api-reference/app-management/apps/app-instance/get-app-instance)

#### Development Entry points
1. [`/api/oauth/v1/authorize/`(route.ts)](./src/app/api/oauth/v1/authorize/route.ts)
   * Implements the [installation URL](https://dev.wix.com/docs/build-apps/build-your-app/authentication/oauth#step-1-user-installs-your-app) in Wix App Oauth flow, which defines some state and redirects to Wix App Oauth URL, including the redirect URL to the callback endpoint in the application.<br>
2. [`/api/oauth/v1/signup/`(route.ts)](./src/app/api/oauth/v1/signup/route.ts)
   * Implements the [redirect URL](https://dev.wix.com/docs/build-apps/build-your-app/authentication/oauth#step-3-wix-redirects-user-to-apps-redirecturl) which received the authorization code and exchanges it for an access token and invokes [Get app instance API](https://dev.wix.com/docs/rest/api-reference/app-management/apps/app-instance/get-app-instance) using it.

### Webhooks
* Webhooks support using [Wix Apps Webhooks API](https://dev.wix.com/docs/build-apps/developer-tools/apis-and-webhooks/webhooks)
* Parse JWT token from Wix using app secret and verify signature
* Example "App Installed" and "App Removed" webhooks

#### Development Entry points
1. [`/api/webhooks/v1/install/`(route.ts)](./src/app/api/webhooks/v1/install/route.ts)
    * Parse the JWT token from Wix using app secret and verify signature, allowing you to add your logic to handle the "App Installed" webhook
2. [`/api/webhooks/v1/uninstall/`(route.ts)](./src/app/api/webhooks/v1/uninstall/route.ts)
    * Parse the JWT token from Wix using app secret and verify signature, allowing you to add your logic to handle the "App Installed" webhook
